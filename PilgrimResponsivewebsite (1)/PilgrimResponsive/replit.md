## Data Flow

### Client-Side Only
- **Static content delivery** - No backend database or API calls
- **Local state management** - JavaScript handles UI state (menu toggles, scroll positions)
- **Form data** - Currently set up for contact form but no backend processing implemented

### Event-Driven Architecture
- DOM event listeners for user interactions
- Scroll events for navbar styling
- Click events for navigation and menu toggles

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Font Awesome 6.0** - Icon library for spiritual and navigation icons
- **Google Fonts** - Typography (Playfair Display, Open Sans)

### Browser APIs
- **Scroll API** - For smooth scrolling and scroll position detection
- **DOM API** - For element manipulation and event handling

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting Ready
- **No build process required** - Direct file serving
- **CDN compatible** - All external resources loaded via CDN
- **Mobile optimized** - Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Scalability Considerations
- Clean separation of concerns (HTML structure, CSS styling, JS behavior)
- Modular CSS with utility classes and reusable components
- Semantic HTML structure for SEO and accessibility
- Performance optimized with external font and icon loading

### Future Backend Integration Points
- Contact form submission endpoint
- Content management system integration
- User authentication for booking/reservation features
- Database integration for dynamic content (destinations, testimonials)

The current architecture provides a solid foundation for a spiritual tourism website with room for backend integration as the application grows in complexity and functionality.
